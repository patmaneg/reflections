What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates the .git directory.
I need it to begin my git commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary area between the working directory and the repository. It has the files that I am going to
commit to the repository.
