Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Just to be sure about what to send to remote and not have all the time being connected to remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to clone two remote repository in github
Clone is to make a copy from a github repository into my local computer
Branch is kind of new version of my code
